# Lists for Twitter Blue Blocker
The JSON lists in this repository were created for the [Blue Blocker Extension](https://github.com/kheina-com/Blue-Blocker), utilizing the pre-existing CSV lists from travisbrown's [blue](https://github.com/travisbrown/blue) and esqueer's [twitter_blue_blocklist](https://github.com/esqueer/twitter_blue_blocklist). 
### **There are other 5 JSON lists that can be found in bkh55's [BlueBlockerJsonReadyBlockList](https://github.com/bkh555/BlueBlockerJsonReadyBlockList). PLEASE CHECK IT OUT !!!**

The algorithm I made can be downloaded and used: 
```shell
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Ohnto-IT/Lists-for-Twitter-Blue-Blocker.git

# Change directory to the cloned repository
$ cd Lists-for-Twitter-Blue-Blocker/Code

# Run the program
$ ./csv_to_json /path/to/your/csvfile.csv USERID_COLUMN SCREENNAME_COLUMN
```
###### Please note that the CSV file should have columns referring to ``User_ID`` and ``Screenname`` (or ``Name``). The column names can vary, but their purpose must remain the same.
## Installing Blue Blocker
Blue Blocker is a free browser extension that automatically blocks all undesired Twitter Blue verified users that are appearing on your screen.

[Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blue-blocker/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/blue-blocker/hicoljclclooehbejnglkgohmclmipip).

### Although many of these accounts no longer exist or aren't subscribed to Twitter Blue anymore, these lists will certainly help filter out far-right "individuals".
